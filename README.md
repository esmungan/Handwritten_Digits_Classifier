## Handwritten Digits Classifier with Neural Networks

   This project was originally going to be done as a part of [Deep Learning Fundamentals](https://app.dataquest.io/course/deep-learning-fundamentals) class on DataQuest but the [dataset from UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits) and the implementation requirements were not challenging enough, so I modified the dataset and methodology.
   
* **Concepts learned:** Scikit-learn library in Python and Neural Network optimization schemes
* **Main challenges:** Performance changes with respect to the size of the data, Run-time challenges of the grid-search algorithm

The aim of this project is to classify handwritten digits in the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) correctly using feedforward neural networks. The data is composed of 28x28 images in gray scale with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255.For sake of simplicity, the data is retrieved from [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data).
